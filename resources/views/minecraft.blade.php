<h1>Information about MINECRAFT</h1>
    </div>
<p>Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. </p>
   <p> The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language.</p>
    <p> Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011,</p>
        <p> with Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development. </p>
            <p> Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time,</p>
                <p> with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2021.</p>
